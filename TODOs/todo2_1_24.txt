Todo: finish the state machine, adapt for the release. 
SD card fix
Add beep and test solution (removed xte correction and track following)

Testing: simple steering. 


Space: wide open; Field or smth. Could do 100 metres? Depends on the flight time. How big is the space? Can be any wide open space? The only problem. 
To find out: - hang time
- a good space with no much trees (possibly Coquitlam, or other fields possibly 200x200m or more)
- time for the parachute to deploy
- Testing: altitude, deistance, conditions (pid coefficients)
